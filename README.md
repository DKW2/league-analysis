# league-analysis
## Abstract
  Analyzes game data from the popular game, League of Legends. Insert more abstract stuff here!
## game plan
1. organize ourselves- 3 committed members: Derek, Ryan, Julian
2. work with riot games api
  * create code for many different calls 
  * create code to parse through feedback and store into dictionaries/lists
3. gather data- using Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends
  * create a working code to sort calls from API
  * gather a list of summoner names 
    * pro playeres/ challnger players
4. create visuals of data 
 * using numpy and pandas
 * possible ideas:
   + histogram of preferred position over ranks
   + average mastery of champions
   + progession through ranks

# when analysis results and drawing conclusions about the LCS, bear in mind the data set we are using, most likely it is incomplete with small errors. Any conclusions using a large part of this dataset with most likely not be affected by these errors.
